A game made to honor PacMan's 40th birthday. The game has 3 phases: First you must eat all the cupcakes around the level. Then PacMan speeds up and is able to eat the level walls as they are made of cake. After that, PacMan must interact with candles which then display a fun fact about PacMan's history.
